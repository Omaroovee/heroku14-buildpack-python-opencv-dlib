# Wattary: A Conversational AI Agent that interacts with humans and learns from their behaviour.

In his game-changer published research paper, Alan Turing provided a satisfactory operational definition of Machine intelligence through proposing what so called Turing Test.
He argued, <i>“A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer”.</u>

Turing’s test deliberately avoided direct physical interaction between interrogator and the computer, because physical simulation of a person is unnecessary for intelligence.
However, the so-called Total Turing-Test included a video signal so that the interrogator can test the subject’s perceptual abilities, as well as the opportunity for the interrogator to pass physical objects “through the hatch.”

In this context, we are delighted to introduce Wattary which is nothing but an AI personal assistant based on what so-called Total Turing-Test. 

First, let us look at what a person can typically gain from his human personal assistant.
Broadly speaking, I would presume he might help with routine work such as: organizing calendar, telling news, booking a flight, reserving a table at a restaurant, or even help with
basic house hold cores in a superficial way.

Wattary acts as a virtual personal assistant in lieu of the human one, for the betterment of the way that a person can do his routine Wattary can provide the following to every user:

1.	An accessible conversational and vocal interface to interact with the user, that is, the user can access Wattary from his mobile phone or from a web application through voice or text and Wattary will respond for his commands in the same way.

2.	A comprehensive control over user’s smart home through voice commands. [E.g. switch off the light, set the temperature to 22, .etc.]

3.	Summarizing the latest news-flash when the user has no ability to read it. e.g. when driving a car through a big traffic.

4.	Recommending a good restaurant to go, a movie to see tonight or a suitable book to read based on user’s taste.

5.	Organizing user’s schedule and send a voice note to him before every event.

It is worth mentioning that Wattary will do all of that through using machine learning algorithms i.e. the performance of Wattary will improve with every interaction!
